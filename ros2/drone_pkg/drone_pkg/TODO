1. need to implement a object avoidance system using zed camera. there is a example in example folder named zed_ros_to_mavlink.py and zed_yolo_node.py 
    however these are old and doesnt use mavros which makes this much easier. 
    -look at the example scripts particulary at which messages where sent and how the data from the zed camera was changed to adapt it to a mavlink message
    - create a node that takes info from the zed topics and publishes the data needed for object avoidance
